## Overview

This project implements and verifies an **end-to-end 8-bit FPGA CPU system**.  
The CPU core is implemented in **handwritten Verilog (RTL)** using a classic **IF / ID / EX / MEM / WB** five-stage pipeline and is integrated with board peripherals via **memory-mapped I/O (MMIO)** to form a complete embedded computing platform.

The work covers the full engineering flow: **RTL design → Vivado synthesis & implementation → bitstream generation → board programming & verification** on a **Nexys A7 (Artix-7)** FPGA. Execution on real hardware demonstrates a reproducible execution path from instruction fetch through ALU and memory to external peripherals.

## Board-level Verification

### Demo: program execution and display of `0x42`

Upon reset, the CPU executes a preloaded instruction stream and writes the computed result via MMIO to the display register. The Nexys A7 seven-segment display then shows **`0x42`** (decimal 66).

## Key contributions

- **End-to-end FPGA engineering loop** — Handwritten Verilog (RTL) → synthesis & implementation → bitstream → board verification.  
- **Five-stage pipelined microarchitecture** — IF / ID / EX / MEM / WB partitioning with pipeline registers, control logic and flush support.  
- **Embedded platform integration (MMIO)** — Memory-mapped I/O decouples core and peripherals (7-seg / LEDs / switches).  
- **Reproducible artifacts** — Repository and Release include validated sources, constraints, reports and a bitstream.

## Verification & artifacts

Provided for reproducibility and review:

- `hdl/` — handwritten Verilog (RTL) sources  
- `constraints/Nexys-A7-100T.xdc` — board pin & clock constraints  
- `bitstream/top_v1.bit` — verified bitstream (Release asset)

## Status & limitations

- **Completed**: RTL implementation, five-stage pipeline, MMIO interface, Vivado implementation, and hardware demo.  
- **Current limitation**: Hardware forwarding and stall units not yet implemented. Current demo uses software-inserted NOPs to manage data hazards. Future work will prioritize forwarding/stall logic and expanded test coverage.

**Project note:** This project was independently developed by a 12-year-old student. With no formal mentorship, he relied solely on online videos and AI-assisted learning to complete the entire design and implementation. Experts are kindly invited to review the project and provide feedback or suggestions on how to best support his future development.
